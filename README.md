# My Portfolio (React)

## Description

*As of Aug 2024, this has been completely rewritten in TypeScript and Tailwind CSS!*

This is an updated version of [my old portfolio](https://nathangero.github.io/my-portfolio/) but this time written in React! 

Here you'll find a section about me, some of my projects I've created/worked on, and my resume. Thank you for taking the time to visit, and feel free to reach out to me for job opportunities.

This site is mobile **and** dark theme friendly!

## Learning Points

* Tailwind CSS is just quicker and easier CSS. The free version doesn't have component class like Bootstrap, but I actually think it's more robust than Bootstrap because of it. Some things may take more setup, but I think the trade-off is worth it.
* TypeScript is very useful for error checking and passing in arguments/props. It ensures that there aren't confliting data types, which I always prefer.
